## Hello! 👋

I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 5 years of experience building reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems for some of the most prominent companies in Europe.

The main repository here is an Autopsy ingest module I wrote for Facebook's Messenger (Beta) on Windows 10. There are also a couple of toy projects that I made for fun once and no longer maintain, as well as dozens of forks of open source projects that I contribute to every now and then.
